    //Given a list of objects representing database entities with fields such as id, name, and timestamp, ensure that no two entities are considered equal if their id fields are different.
    //Simulate a cache where objects are stored. Objects with the same hashcode should overwrite existing objects in the cache. Consider how would you design the hashcode method to facilitate this.
    //Create a method that returns a JSON representation of an object. The method should make use of the toString method to facilitate this.
    //Implement the toString method in a class holding a large dataset to print a “summary” version of the dataset, facilitating debugging and logging.
    //Create a generic method to swap the positions of two elements in an array.
    //Create a class Pair which can hold a pair of objects, the objects can be of any type.
    //Create a day scheduler application that uses an enum to represent the days of the week.
    // The application should be able to assign and retrieve activities for each day.
    //Create a simulation of a traffic light system using an enum to represent the different states of a traffic light.
    //Create a generic repository class for storing objects. The repository should use a HashMap internally. Override equals and hashcode methods to ensure the correct behavior of the repository.
    //Extend an enum representing car types to include properties such as average price and manufacturer. Override the toString method to provide a descriptive string representing each enum constant.
